                                                       Mango
Fertilizers : The best Mango Tree fertilizers for growing mango trees contain a 1:1:1 or 2:2:2 NPK ratio.
              For mature mango trees, NPK values such as 6-3-16 or 0-0-22 are recommended. 
              Very little to no nitrogen (N) is needed for mature mango trees. 
              The focus should be on potash or potassium (K).
Irrigation method : Drip and under tree sprinkler system.
Steps to grow : Step 1: After devouring the pulp of the mango seed, clean its hard shell.
                Step 2: Carefully cut open the shell without damaging the inner seed.
                Step 3: Peel off the thin brown layer on the smaller seed and wash it clean.
                Step 4: In a container with some coconut fiber (coir), place the washed seed and sprinkle water so that the coir absorbs it.
                Step 5: Cover the container with a lid and place it in the shade.
                Step 6: Sprinkle some water every few days if the coir is dry. Ensure that the water is just enough
                         to keep the coir moist and there is not too much of it.In just a few days, the seed should begin to sprout and in 10 days,
                         the seed should grow inch-long roots with a stem popping out in the other direction.
