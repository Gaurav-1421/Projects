Fertilizers : Apple trees require nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium -- the three numbers on fertilizer bags
              as well as various trace minerals. For home growers, fertilizers should have a higher nitrogen ratio 
              to fuel healthy growth. Common granular 20-10-10 fertilizer is suitable for apples.

Irrigation method : Drip irrigation, under tree sprinkler, and overhead sprinkler.

Steps to grow : Step 1: Cut down the middle of an apple and take out the seeds. You may need a few apples always remember
                        on average only 30% of your seeds will germinate. 
                Step 2: Seeds should take about a month to germinate.
                Step 3: Once the seeds have germinated just drop them into any pots about 1 - 2" deep and 
                        cover in good compost.
                Step 4: The Most Important Step: Grafting, most helpful is the "Whip and Tongue" graft.
                Step 5:  Watch closely for results if you graft is growing leaves then it is successful if it isn't it probably isn't successful, 
                         After 1-3 months take off the grafting tape.
